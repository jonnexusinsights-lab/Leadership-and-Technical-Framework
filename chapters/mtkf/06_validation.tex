\section{Validation Milestone: "End-to-End AI Project"}

This is the ultimate milestone to validate the knowledge acquired through this framework.

\subsection{How to Structure It}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Problem}: The manager must identify a real-world problem (either internal or client-facing).
    \item \textbf{The Solution}: They must technically justify the selection of tools across Software Engineering, Data, and AI.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Criteria}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Trade-off Analysis}: The manager’s ability to explain the compromises made (e.g., why they chose RAG over Fine-tuning, or why they selected a specific database engine).
        \item \textbf{Holistic Design}: The ability to design and understand a solution that effectively integrates all three required domains.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
