\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Summary}
This TKF establishes the standard of technical competency required for a manager to act as an effective bridge between business objectives and technological execution. It is rooted in the transition from "digital literacy" to "engineering judgment," enabling the autonomous assessment of risks, costs, and viability without total dependency on specialists.

\subsection{Guiding Principles}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Priority of Judgment over Syntax}: The focus is on understanding how and why systems work, gaining a high-level conceptual grasp of how they are coded.
    \item \textbf{Architectural Vision}: The ability to view the entire system (End-to-End) and its underlying dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Trade-off Evaluation}: Every technical decision involves a compromise between cost, time, quality, and scalability.
    \item \textbf{Technological Agnosticism}: A focus on fundamental principles that transcend specific vendors or programming languages.
\end{enumerate}
