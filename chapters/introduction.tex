This document details the comprehensive **Management Framework**, designed to provide a structured approach to technical leadership and management.

It is composed of three key pillars:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Management Technical Knowledge Framework (MTKF)}: A guide to the technical competencies required for effective management, moving beyond basic literacy to engineering judgment.
    \item \textbf{Leadership Skills Framework}: A structure for the soft skills and leadership qualities necessary to inspire and guide teams.
    \item \textbf{Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)}: A collection of standardized processes to ensure consistency and efficiency in operations.
\end{enumerate}

Together, these frameworks provide the necessary tools for a manager to bridge the gap between business strategy and technical execution.
